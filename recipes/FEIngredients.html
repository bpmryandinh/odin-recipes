    <ul>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> I tested this recipe using large chicken eggs. Of course, you can use medium, small,
            or jumbo-sized, but just be aware that you may need to adjust cooking times accordingly. </li>
        <li> <strong>Butter:</strong> I like to cook my eggs in a little unsalted butter. It browns as the eggs cook,
            imparting this gorgeous slightly nutty flavor to the edges; however, you can also use a neutral oil, if you
            prefer. </li>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong> I use kosher salt to season my eggs, but you can also use table salt or fine sea salt
            if that’s what you have on hand. </li>
        <li><strong>Ground Pepper:</strong> I love freshly ground pepper on an egg. Feel free to leave it out if you
            prefer, and if it’s not freshly ground, I’d recommend skipping altogether. </li>
    </ul>
