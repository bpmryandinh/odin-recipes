    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by adding 1 tsp. butter to a small nonstick pan and placing it over medium heat. </li>
        <li>While the butter is melting, crack the egg into a small bowl (I typically use a small pinch bowl or a
            plastic take-out condiment ramekin). Pre-cracking the egg into a container gives you the opportunity to pick
            out any bits of egg shell that may have fallen in if the shell didn’t crack cleanly. Also, pouring from a
            bowl rather than cracking directly into the pan decreases the risk of a broken yolk, while allowing you to
            gently guide the egg into a more rounded shape. </li>
        <li>Once the butter has melted and has just started to foam slightly, give it a swirl to coat the bottom of the
            pan as evenly as possible, then gently pour the egg into the center of the pan. As soon as the egg is in the
            pan, season it with a little salt and decrease the temperature to medium-low. At this point, if you want
            that perfect flat white, you can take a fork and gently poke at the surface of the white, especially right
            where the thick higher-sitting egg white meets the thin flatter egg white. The goal is to get the egg white
            to sit as flat and even as possible, so it will cook as evenly as possible. This step is optional, but
            highly recommended.</li>
        <li>If making a sunny side-up egg, cook the egg until the top is set but the yolk is still runny, about 3
            minutes. Monitor the temperature in the pan closely during this time: If it's too high, the white will get
            too crispy and the yolk will start to get bubbles spitting up in the center. If it’s too low, the egg will
            never cook. I like to go by the sound: It should stay at a gentle sizzle. </li>
        <li>If, after 3 minutes, the very top of the white still has that translucent slimy look, try adding a little
            more butter to the pan, letting it melt, then gently spooning it over just the uncooked white to set it.
            Alternately, you can add 1 tsp. water to the pan and cover it for 15 seconds to steam the top. Be aware,
            though, that you risk clouding the top of the egg yolk and spoiling that beautiful bright yellow yolked
            look. </li>
        <li>Of course, if you want to make an over-easy egg, you don’t need to worry about any of this: Follow the above
            steps until the egg hits the pan, then cook for 1 to 2 minutes, just until the top is no longer runny but
            still not set. Using the plastic spatula, carefully flip the egg. For an over-easy egg, cook until the
            bottom is set but the yolk is still completely jiggly when you poke it, 30 seconds to a minute longer. If
            you’d like it over-medium, cook it 1 to 2 minutes after flipping, until the edge of the yolk feels firm but
            the middle is still slightly jiggly. And if you’d like it over-hard, extend the cook time to 2 to 3 minutes;
            the egg is done when the yolk feels totally firm but just slightly fudgy in the center. </li>
        <li>Once the egg is cooked, season with freshly ground pepper and transfer it to your plate with a plastic
            spatula. (<strong>Never</strong> use a metal spatula in a nonstick pan!)</li>
    </ol>
