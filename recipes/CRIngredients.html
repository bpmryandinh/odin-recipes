    <!-- Unordered list of ingredients -->
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Milk:</strong> I recommend 2% or whole milk, but know that almond milk will also work (I’ve tried
            it!) See my tips below for ensuring your milk is at the right temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Granulated sugar:</strong> this is used to <em>sweeten</em> the cinnamon rolls and to help activate
            the yeast.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Quick rise yeast:</strong> use <em>quick rise or instant yeast</em> in this recipe to help the
            cinnamon rolls rise faster. You can also use active dry yeast, but the cinnamon rolls may take slightly
            longer to rise.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Butter:</strong> <em>the one and only</em>. I prefer to use salted butter but unsalted is great too.
            You’ll need it for the dough, filling and icing.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Egg + egg yolk:</strong> this recipe calls for 1 egg and 1 egg yolk for the perfect texture and rich
            consistency in the dough.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bread flour:</strong> to help keep these cinnamon rolls soft and fluffy, we’re using <em>bread
                flour</em>, which has a higher protein level to help lighten the cinnamon roll texture. The higher
            amounts of protein help to produce more gluten, which gives cinnamon roll the chewy, soft texture you know
            and love.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Brown sugar:</strong> personally, I love using dark brown sugar for more robust molasses sweet
            flavor in those cinnamon swirls, but light brown sugar will work!
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Cinnamon</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Salt:</strong> cinnamon rolls made without salt tastes very plain and in addition, salt also helps
            to control yeast in cinnamon roll recipes so don’t skip it.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>For the icing:</strong> the icing is truly unforgettable too! Just cream cheese, butter,
            <em>powdered sugar</em> and <em>vanilla</em>.
        </li>
    </ul>
