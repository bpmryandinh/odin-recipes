# odin-recipes
Web Project Odin Project 

## About
- This is a site with 3 recipes 
- They might not be the best, but that's okay 

## Legend
- Recipe files have the full name of the dish spelt out
- Ingredient files use the abbreviated forms of each 
    - example: CRIngredients.html has the list of ingredients 

## Future Installments 
- More recipes might be added
- The site will look more presentable and not look like some sketchy site.
- I need to keep track of which sites don't need to have a separate tab after clicking so that the site doesn't get busy with the same tabs.

## Learning Outcomes
- I was able to apply what I was taught about html.
- I was able to create a bare bones website with only html.
- I discovered recipes that I will probably not use in the future unfortunately.

## Browser Trials 
<ul>
    <li><strong>FireFox:</strong> The site runs smoothly on there. No issues</li>
    <li><strong>Microsoft Edge:</strong> The site runs smoothly on there. No issues. Had to copy and paste the url of the site to there, since my default browser was set to FireFox.</li>
</ul>
